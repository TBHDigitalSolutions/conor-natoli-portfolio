### Best Method to Integrate the Interactive Tooling Widget into Your Resume Portfolio Page

To showcase the interactive tooling widget effectively on your resume/portfolio page, consider the following strategies. These ensure the widget is presented prominently, aligns with your branding, and highlights your role in its creation.

---

### 1. **Use a Dedicated Section on the Portfolio Page**
   - Create a prominent **"Featured Project"** or **"Interactive Creations"** section to draw attention.
   - Include a descriptive header, such as:  
     *"Custom Interactive Tooling Widget – Tailored for [Company Name]"*
   - Provide a **short description** about the project:
     - **Problem solved**: What challenge this widget addresses.
     - **Technology used**: Mention Three.js, GLTF, or AR features.
     - **Your Role**: Highlight your contributions (design, development, etc.).

#### Example Layout:
- **Left Side:** A static preview image or small interactive element of the widget.
- **Right Side:** Project description with a **"Launch Interactive Widget"** button to open the full experience in a modal or new page.

---

### 2. **Use a Modal Pop-Up for Interactivity**
   - A modal window provides a clean, focused user experience, allowing users to interact with the tooling widget without leaving the portfolio page.
   - This approach keeps your portfolio page concise while offering detailed interactivity on demand.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Add a Preview Section:** Include an iframe or static screenshot with a **"View Interactive Demo"** button below it.
2. **Trigger the Modal:** When the button is clicked, the modal opens with the full widget.
3. **Fullscreen Modal Design:**
   - Overlay the widget with semi-transparent backgrounds to focus the user's attention.
   - Add **close options** (X button or clicking outside the modal).
4. **Custom Styling:** Brand the modal using your portfolio's colors and fonts to maintain a cohesive design.

---

### 3. **Make It Stand Out for the Specific Company**
   - **Personalization Matters:** Add a small tagline or badge, e.g., "Created for [Company Name]" or "A Custom Solution for Interactive Tooling."
   - Use the company’s branding subtly in the project description or background gradient of the widget section.
   - Add an **optional "Behind the Scenes" section**:
     - Showcase snippets of code, a short walkthrough video, or a description of your development process.

---

### 4. **Embed the Widget in Its Own Page**
   - If the widget is resource-heavy, consider embedding it in a dedicated page linked from your portfolio.
   - Provide a link like:  
     *"Click here for the full interactive experience!"*
   - This prevents your main portfolio page from being bogged down by large assets or loading times.

---

### Recommended Implementation
The **modal pop-up approach** is ideal:
- It balances user engagement with a clean, clutter-free portfolio page.
- Users can interact with the widget without navigating away, maintaining their focus on your work.

#### Benefits:
- **Interactive Showcase:** Highlights the widget in a focused environment.
- **Engaging Experience:** Keeps users on your portfolio while delivering high interactivity.
- **Scalability:** Allows future projects to use the same modal system with minimal rework.

### Actionable Steps
1. **Create a New Section:** 
   - Add a "Featured Project" section with a preview (image or iframe).
   - Write a compelling description emphasizing the widget’s purpose and your contributions.

2. **Develop a Modal:**
   - Use HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a library like `React Modal` for implementation.
   - Include the 3D tooling widget in the modal using the `<model-viewer>` or Three.js script you provided.

3. **Ensure Optimization:**
   - Lazy-load assets (3D models, textures) to prevent slowing down your main portfolio page.
   - Test responsiveness to ensure a smooth experience on mobile and desktop.

---

### Example User Flow
1. **Landing Page Preview:** Users see a visual or text teaser for the tooling widget.
2. **Modal Interaction:** Clicking "View Demo" opens a fullscreen modal with the fully interactive widget.
3. **Close and Return:** Users exit the modal to continue exploring your portfolio seamlessly.
